This is a demo project, codenamed "skriphy" built in ReactJS. It is a simple GIPHY search web app, utilizing modern browser/Javascript/React features.

- Built exclusively with React Hooks! (no class components)
- ES6+ and beyond (arrow functions, destructuring... even optional chaining)
- Native browser lazy loading for images.
- Browser localStorage for client caching.
- Styles made with SASS pre-processor.

Note #1: Please make sure you have a GIPHY API key to enable functionality in the app.

Note #2: The GIFs in the search results are currently NOT optimized for mobile networks, due to their large filesize. This app is for demo purposes, avoid using this on a metered connection.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See CRA-README.md for more info.

The files "src/SkriphyApp.js", as well as all the sub-folders in "src" contain code created by the author. All the rest, is mostly bootstrap code by create-react-app.
