This is a demo project, codenamed "skriphy" built in ReactJS. It is a simple GIPHY search web app, utilizing modern browser/Javascript/React features.

- Fully functional, built exclusively with React Hooks! (no Class components)
- ES6+ and beyond (arrow functions, template literals, destructuring... even optional chaining)
- Mobile-first design!
- Native browser lazy-loading for images.
- Browser localStorage for client caching.
- Styles made with SASS pre-processor.

# Notes

Note #1: Please make sure you have a GIPHY API key to enable functionality in the app.

Note #2: The GIFs in the search results are currently NOT optimized for mobile networks, due to their large filesize. This app is for demo purposes, avoid using this on a metered connection.

# Technical info

The compiled ready-to-run project is in the **"build"** folder, but opening "index.html" in a browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See CRA-README.md for more info.

The files "src/SkriphyApp.js", as well as all the sub-folders in "src" contain code created by the author (me). All the rest, is mostly bootstrap code by create-react-app.
